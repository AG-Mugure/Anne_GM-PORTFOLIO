  <!-- Overview / Intro Section -->
  <section id="overview">
    <h1> Hello There!, Iam Anne</h1>
    <p>I am an aspiring full-stack developer currently learning through the Power Learn Project. 
      One of my resolutions this year was to learn and become a Fullstack developer.
       So this opportunity was a blessing in every way to help me get there and achieve more.
      I would like to create digital solutions that are not just functional but meaningful. I am intentional, reflective and driven by curiosity beacause there is always something new to learn.
      This portfolio is a glimpse into what I have been learning and building so far.
      Welcome!</p>

  <!-- Programming Languages -->
  <section id="languages">
    <h2> Programming Languages</h2>
    <p>Some of the languages that I have worked with and still familiarizing myself with:</p>
    <div>
      <span class="tag">HTML</span>
      <p>It is super fun seeing how  one can bring content and thoughts into life beautifully</p>
      <span class="tag">CSS</span>
      <p>Everything is now amazing with some tweaks on how one wants the font,
        background and every styling on the text just to help users interact.</p>
      <span class="tag">Python</span>
      <p>Very simple language in every aspect with few aspects to remember
         that just helps you output flow.</p>
      <span class="tag">Git</span>
      <p>Git was definitely not my forte in every aspect
         and getting to work with it flawlesly later on,
        was a WIN!</p>
      <span class="tag">GitHub</span>
      <p>A space that was just I was just viewing people's ideas with little understanding on the workings.
        Then I get to learn how to use it to post my code and ideas. I get to share ideas and learn new things.
        I can also contribute to future projects on the platform.
        The future looks good from where Iam..
      </p>
      <span class="tag">VS Code</span>
      <p>Easy to work with and integrate with different languages and moreso GitHub which
        I can work with while on VS code. 
        Fascinating!! Right?
      </p>
